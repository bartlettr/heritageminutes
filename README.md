# Heritage Minutes Grand Tour Website
This is the website for the Heritage Minutes Grand Tour.

Current issues / enhancements (in no order):
1) Date in Edit Location
2) Fancier cluster icons? Maybe green ones when there is a location (or locations) that have been visited.
3) A search in the minutes table.
4) A legend in the map.
5) Mobile version.
6) Sources in info box.
7) Link to Twitter/Instagram for visited locations

To save docker image and move to server:

    docker save -o <save image to path> <image name>
    docker load -i <path to image tar file>
